# ArrayDequeList

[ArrayDeque](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/ArrayDeque) that implements the [List](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/List) interface, to support fast random access to its elements (unlike pure ArrayDeque).

This class is at the core of many computation algorithms in our app [Urban Biker](http://urban-bike-computer.com/), so it has been proven countless times.


### To use this as a library in your app

Add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation 'com.github.Sublimis:ArrayDequeList:v1.0'
```
